# Codex Context

## Recent Enhancements
- Added configurable signal warm-up period with yellow-phase transitions before adaptive/agent control engages.
- Introduced anti-aliased Pygame rendering (gfxdraw) with vsync/hardware toggles to reduce jitter.
- Expanded DQN training CLI with AMP, gradient clipping, larger transformer sizes, and AsyncVectorEnv-based parallel environments to saturate GPUs.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Consider caching road polylines into pre-rendered surfaces or using dirty-rect updates for further FPS gains.
- Evaluate lane-level queues or turn pockets so the controller can reason about protected/permitted phases.
- Profile vector env CPU usage; consider multiprocessing start-method tweaks or shared-state batching if scaling beyond ~8 envs.
